gliInDesign Layer Tool
=============

Description
-------


This is an AppleScript for doing various layer "actions" on all open documents. Like:

* "Einblenden" -- show selected layer(s)
* "Ausblenden" -- hide selected layer(s)
* "Löschen" -- delete selected layer(s)
* "Umbenennen" -- rename selected layer
* "Kopieren" -- copy selected layer(s)
* "Zusammenführen" -- merge selected layer(s)

After executing the script in InDesign you'll be presented with a "function" dialog.
This is where you can choose from one of the functions above.
After choosing a function you'll be presented a list of layers depending on the function you chose in the previous dialog.



Contributing
------------

Want to contribute? Great! You sure know what to do, but this is my first repository so I don't know if I am doing this right :)

File-Formats
-----------
    Normally I use the *.scpt Format because it it precompiled but at the same time contains the code and viewable via QuickLook. 
    I'm also commiting an *.applescript File, just because it it readable on github and the precompiled not.
    They should be in sync, always.
    
Localization
-----------
    At the moment the script is mixed, english and german. with the documentation beeing in english but most used Strings in german.

Installation
-----------

    put the file in the application folder "Adobe InDesign CS5" > "Scripts" > "Scripts Panel"


Usage
-----

    open InDesign CS5 and some documents and start the script from the "Scripts Panel"
