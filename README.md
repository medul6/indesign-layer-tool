This is an AppleScript for doing various layer "actions" on all open documents. Like:

* "Einblenden" -- show selected layer(s)
* "Ausblenden" -- hide selected layer(s)
* "Löschen" -- delete selected layer(s)
* "Umbenennen" -- rename selected layer
* "Kopieren" -- copy selected layer(s)
* "Zusammenführen" -- merge selected layer(s)
